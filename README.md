# Autonomous-2025
This project is a result of a full semester course ME 691-XIII Autonomous Vehicles offered at IIT Gandhinagar by prof Harish PM. The project is completely student run and still under progress, there are further developments on the way. We have acheived Level 3 Autonomy on an Electric Golf cart witha few hardware changes.

There are multiple sections of the cart on which modifications were done.
